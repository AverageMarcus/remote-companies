# remote-companies
A list of tech companies that hire globally remotely, that jobseekers can fork and edit to suit their own job hunt or use as-is.

This [list of companies](https://github.com/Codesee-io/remote-companies/blob/main/company-list.md) that hire globally-remote. It's provided to help tech jobseekers from around the world a starting point for their job hunt. If you would like to add to this list or correct any information presented, PRs are welcome.

We recommend that you fork this repo if you want to use this to create a custom list for your own job hunt.

If you want to see some documentation for how to gently automate job hunting using lists like these, we've written a [blog post here](https://codesee.io/blog/finding-your-first-job-in-tech).
